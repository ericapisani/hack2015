# Hack the North 2015 - Voyagr

Voyagr is a map-based diary for travellers and backpackers. Typically, trip blogs are typically arranged in chronological/itinerary fashion. This has been the way it is always done.

With this project, we attempt to break this paper metaphor by presenting your journeys and travels on an interactive map. The photos you take on your adventures can be automatically synchronized from phones and cameras, and placed on the web or mobile app.

The focus of geography rather than time is important. Mapping evokes a sense of accomplishment as the viewer accumulates his or her journeys across the globe. In this age of readily available personal navigation, we at Voyagr believe that travellers deserve to be better connected to the earth.

We would like to thank Karel Vuong for his help on the product and logo design.
